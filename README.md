I wrote `unicode_explorer` to help me choose commonly-viewable glyphs to use in terminal applications.  It attempts to display pages of Unicode characters by their code points; if the character is unprintable, nothing will be displayed.  One can navigate the space with the arrow keys.

`unicode_explorer` is unlikely to see proper release and feature requests will probably not be granted, but you are welcome to base your own projects off of it if you find some bit of it to be useful.
